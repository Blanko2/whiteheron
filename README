This project is a boundary detection system created for WaiNZ by team White Heron as part of a requirement for Engineering 302 @ Victoria University. 

The project works with a pipeline that passes the image through several filters which then detect the outline of a given river. 
At the moment the system works quite well, but there are additions to be made:

Extending the system to join segmented portions of rivers together.
Further testing on different colored rivers - the program is not well tested on muddy, or oddly colored rivers.
GUI needs further refining 

Another extension is to add in a module to detect cows into the program, which was the initial requirement, but we deemed it beyond our
expertise in the time-frame given to us.

I will likely be extending the program slowly as well.
