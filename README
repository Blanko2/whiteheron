To get this repository: 
	git clone /vol/projects/engr302_2012T2/e302t9/white-heron.git
should give you an output that doesnt mention an empty repository, should
add a file to the repo called README (which is this file).

check youre on the right branch:
	git branch
Output should be *master

To commit and push a file:
	git add . //adds all files in the dir to git's tracker
	git commit -m 'my commit message'
That will have committed your files, but you still need to push!
	git push
that should be all.

recap:
	git clone <repo location>
	<add files, whatever>
	git add .
	git commit -m 'message'
	git push

To pull/get files off the repo:
	
	git pull
